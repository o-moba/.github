Open MOBA is more than just a MOBA game—it’s a creative ecosystem empowering everyone to share directly in its success.

Imagine a game that combines beloved gameplay mechanics from classics like League of Legends and Dota 2 with a fully open model for user-generated content. Picture designing unique characters—including their appearances, backstories, professions, and abilities—and sharing them in an open marketplace, where fans directly support creators by purchasing custom skins and characters.

OMOBA, currently in the early stages of development, aims to become an open-source, blockchain-based multiplayer platform structured as a DAO, transparently distributing profits to creators and contributors. Users will retain full ownership of their creations, choosing between limited editions or unlimited availability.

Beyond characters, envision building entire universes and collaboratively integrating your creations into a vibrant Web3 multiverse. Assets will be managed through NFTs, with cryptocurrencies used as in-game tokens.

OMOBA will also closely integrate with [Ekza Space](https://github.com/ekza-space/), benefiting from mutual innovations and collaborative growth.
